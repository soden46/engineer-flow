# Performance

Use this skill when work involves latency, throughput, resource usage, query efficiency, rendering cost, memory pressure, or scaling bottlenecks.

This skill is technology agnostic.

## Measure First

Do not optimize solely from intuition.

Identify:

- the slow operation
- current baseline
- dominant cost
- expected improvement
- acceptable tradeoffs

Use measurements appropriate to the system.

## Common Bottlenecks

Investigate relevant:

- repeated database queries
- N+1 access
- unnecessary network calls
- repeated computation
- inefficient algorithms
- excessive serialization
- large payloads
- blocking I/O
- unnecessary rendering
- memory growth
- contention
- cache misses
- excessive file operations

Do not assume the database is always the bottleneck.

## Database Performance

Consider:

- query count
- query plans
- indexes
- join behavior
- selected columns
- pagination
- batch operations
- eager/bulk loading
- connection usage

Add indexes based on actual query patterns.

## Caching

Cache when:

- computation or retrieval is meaningfully expensive
- reuse is likely
- consistency requirements are understood

Define:

- cache key
- lifetime
- invalidation
- ownership
- failure behavior

Do not add caching merely to hide an inefficient design without understanding correctness implications.

## Memory

Avoid loading unbounded datasets into memory.

Prefer:

- streaming
- chunking
- pagination
- iterators
- bounded batches

when processing large data.

## Concurrency

Parallelism can improve throughput but may increase:

- contention
- memory usage
- rate-limit pressure
- database load
- ordering complexity

Use bounded concurrency.

## Verification

Compare before and after.

Verify:

- functional behavior remains correct
- measured metric improves
- resource usage remains acceptable
- no significant regression is introduced elsewhere

Performance work without measurement should be treated as a hypothesis, not a proven optimization.

## Framework Adaptation

Use native profiling, caching, ORM, worker, and runtime mechanisms from the detected project stack.

Do not invent framework-specific APIs.

## Absorbed Legacy Capability: memory-management

The following framework-agnostic knowledge was preserved from the
previous Engineer Flow capability during consolidation.

# Memory Management

Use memory as conditional infrastructure, not specialist expertise.

## Preflight

Run memory preflight only when prior project/session/workflow context could materially affect correctness. Skip self-contained tasks.

Prefer an active MCP memory tool when the host provides one. Otherwise use:

```bash
node skills/memory-management/scripts/memory.mjs auto --cwd <project-root> --query "<task intent>" --limit 5
```

The command prints `decision: RUN` or `decision: SKIP`. On `RUN`, use only sparse relevant memory and verify it against current code/config.

## Rules

- Memory never consumes primary or support specialist slots.
- Current code/config beats old memory.
- Do not store secrets, `.env` values, raw credentials, or personal data.
- Preserve provenance and status.
- Checkpoint only durable reusable knowledge.

## Checkpoint

After meaningful work, checkpoint only when durable knowledge changed:

```bash
node skills/memory-management/scripts/memory.mjs checkpoint --project <alias> --summary "<durable summary>"
```
